Incremental game made for a school project.
This game was made with an Animal Crossing theme and is inspired from the online game Cookie Clicker.
It uses the framework Bootstrap (HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery).
The code is currently pretty messy. The Javascript code needs to be redone in oriented object programming to be more clean.
